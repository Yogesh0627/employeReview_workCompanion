The feedback should follow these guidelines:
- High scores (7-10) should result in positive feedback, emphasizing strengths and successes.
- Mid-range scores (4-6) should include balanced feedback with areas for improvement and suggestions on how to achieve better results.
- Low scores (1-3) should include constructive criticism, explaining where the employee needs to improve and how they can work toward better performance.

Please provide feedback that is professional, actionable, and considerate of the employee's development in the company.
